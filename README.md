### Description

NerdFeed is a home for all things nerd. Users are able to sign up and create a post (subject/title + content). Users are encouraged to post about anything nerdy (or non-nerdy). NerdFeed is a community where we share our likes/dislikes on video games, esports, movies, tv shows, and anything else!

### How to get Started

All you'll need to do is start the React App and the content will populate! If you would prefer a more curated experience, sign up for an account and provide your likes, interests, or hobbies. Your content will then match your preferences for a better user experience!
